#  Python Calorie Counting Application
A console-based Python application that accurately calculates your calories burnt in a day.

- **Description:** Designed to run on an Android mobile phone, this simple application tracks all calories burnt in a single day. The application accurately calculates and predicts your daily burn using the METS system of energy expenditure during activities. It takes into account your waking and resting times as well as any sport conducted throughout the day.

- **What I Learned:** In this project I further enhanced my python skills by constantly reviewing and improving upon my previous versions of the application. I learned to develop a sound coding standard and how to write easy to understand code.
